> Distance prediction without the need of GPS.
#### AIPI 540 NLP Individual Project | Spring Semester 2022

**Project By:** Snigdha Rudraraju

**Project:** Predicting Distance using accelerometer data and neural networks without the need of GPS.

## Getting Started

Download files in main.py folder
Make sure to place them at same location(same path)
Run streamlit.py

## Details about Equipment 

We used 3 devices here 

**Accelerometer**: Raspberry Pi Pico sensor is used in this project. It measures accelerations in X,Y,Z directions.
**GPS Sensor**: To get distance travelled using signals
**Microcontroller**: Collects the data in sequential order
