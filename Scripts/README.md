Here's where we are housing all the scripts:

* `gpsToDistance.py` : this is the script that we're using to convert gps latitudes and longitudes to distance. 
* `mergingGPSnAccel.py`: this is the script we're using to do linear interpolation on GPS Data
* `iLSTMInference.py`: to use the trained model to calculate outputs
* `Code_Micropython`: libraries and code used for making the microcontroller collect data
